# Funky Finds — Advanced React E-Commerce App

This project is part of my journey with the **Coding Temple Software Engineering Front-End Specialization**. It’s a fun, funky little e-commerce site built with React, TypeScript, Redux Toolkit, and React Query — basically a playground to practice some solid front-end skills with real-world tools.

## Tech Stack

- **React + TypeScript** — typed, component-driven UI
- **Redux Toolkit** — to manage cart state easily and cleanly
- **React Query** — for smooth, declarative data fetching and caching
- **React Router** — navigating between pages
- **Bootstrap** — for quick, responsive styling
- **FakeStoreAPI** — my source for products and categories

## How to Run It Locally

1. Clone the repo:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/CanterCode/ecommerce-site-funky-finds.git
    cd ecommerce-site-funky-finds
    ```

2. Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```

3. Start the dev server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    ```

4. Open your browser to the URL shown (usually http://localhost:5173).

## What You Can Do

- Browse all products right on the homepage.
- Use the category dropdown to filter products dynamically.
- Add items to your cart directly from the product list.
- Click the cart icon to see what’s inside, update quantities, or remove items.
- Checkout to clear your cart and get a confirmation popup.
- The cart state sticks around thanks to session storage — so no surprises when you reload!

## Final Thoughts

This project was a great way for me to put together some important React ecosystem tools and get comfortable with Redux Toolkit and React Query. Plus, working with an API like FakeStoreAPI made it feel more like a real world project and less like a “toy."
